# Characteristics of the official Secret Hitler board game
- The board is made of normal board-game material
- The policy cards are made of wood
- The role cards are made of normal playing card material
- A paper envelope is used to cover the role cards
- The president and chancellor signs are made of wood
- A wooden circle is placed on the board to mark the number of fails

# Changes that will for sure be made
- The name of the game must be different
- (Probably) the words "liberal", "fascist", and "hitler" need to be changed
- (Probably) the words "president" and "chancellor" need to be changed

# Issues with the official game
- The envelopes break over time
- The policy cards can get worn over time
- The role cards can get bent
- The fail indicator piece can fall of and get lost
- Role cards often get stuck together
- Role cards don't get aligned when placed on the board

# Things to consider
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Digital_design

- Choose colors that color blind people can distinguish
- Maybe also use symbols in addition to colors to differentiate between liberal and fascist
- Make it so that people can't read a specific language can still play the game
- Dimensions of the game when packed
- Amount of space it takes up on a table when playing
- The total mass

# Ideas for improvement
- Maximize the use of aluminum for a more "premium build quality", such as on laptops
- Add a mechanism to align policy cards when placed on the board (for example, using magnets)
- Make the policy cards easy to pick up from the board
- Make it impossible to lose the fail counter
- The board can detect when a policy card is placed on a certain slot 
- Make the board be able to identify if a card placed on a specific slot is liberal or fascist
- Make the board identify when counterfeit policy cards are placed
- The game can be box-less, while still ensuring that pieces don't fall out
- Use stronger materials for the role cards
- Make the role cards high tech
- Make all other "pieces" magnetically attach to the board for storage 

# Limitations
## NFC
- NFC tag cards are fixed in shape and the shape can't be easily customized
- Aluminum interferes with NFC
- It would be possible, but difficult to combine NFC cards and magnetic snappingUse 
- When using NFC cards, the board would need a source of power
- Cost

## Aluminum policy cards
- Aluminum is not magnetic, so a magnet would need to be put inside the aluminum policy card
- If the board has an outer layer of aluminum, it would be very difficult to detect when cards are placed on it. We could use the magnetic field from the magnet in the policy card to detect the presence of the policy card. We could also have different positions of magnets inside the liberal and fascist policy cards, and then distinguish between when a liberal and fascist card is placed above it. In this case, the all policy cards would have alignment magnets, and in addition would have identification magnets that differ between liberal and fascist policies  Using this method, we cannot detect counterfeit policy cards.
- Cost

## Magnetic policy cards
- Policy cards should not stick to each other, and must not repel each other to the point that they can't be perfectly stacked and shuffled

## Aluminum
- When aluminum is placed or dropped on aluminum, it could make a loud, unpleasant sound, and potentially damage components

## No box or bag design
- Not all components of the game will be used if there are <10 players. In that case, the unused components shouldn't interfere with playing the game

# Small, individual improvements
## Replace wooden pieces with plastic credit card-sized cards
### Advantages
- Easier to shuffle?

### Disadvantages
- Less satisfying?
- Harder to print on it?

## Make board out of aluminum
### Advantages
- More premium
- More durable

### Disadvantages
- More mass
- Harder to print on?

## Make the president and chancellor signs out of aluminum
### Advantages
- More premium
- More durable

### Disadvantages
- More mass
- Harder to print on?

## Make the president and chancellor signs be engraved instead of printed
### Advantages
- Compatible with aluminum / 3D printing
- Can also be felt in addition to seen

### Disadvantages
- Would be harder to distinguish if both president and chancellor signs are the same color
