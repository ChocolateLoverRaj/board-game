There will be an OLED display. Initially, it will have settings options and a start "button". We can use a combination of regular buttons and rotary encoders (which are a knob + button when pushed down) for the UI.

# 1 button navigation
This is not practically possible.

## 2 button navigation
One "down" / "next" button, one "ok" button.

Initially, one of the rows will be highlighted.
```
Start Game
Settings Option 1
Settings Option 2
```
You can press the next button to navigate to the next row. You can press the ok button to enter a row. This might start the game if you click on start game, or enter a sub-menu.

## 1 button + (knob or 2 buttons) navigation
The knob selects "prev" / "next", "up" / "down", or "left" / "right". The button is "ok". This is similar to 2 button navigation, but you can also navigate up in addition to down, saving time.

## 2 button + (knob or 2 buttons) navigation
In addiiton to the above, there can also be a back button, used to exit sub-menus.
